## Hi there 👋

I'm **Daniel Palacios**, a 4th-year Ph.D. Candidate in **Quantitative & Computational Biosciences** at **Baylor College of Medicine**, and an **NSF Graduate Research Fellow (2024)** and **NLM Fellow (2023)**. My research focuses on building **LLM-based AI agents**, **AutoML systems**, and **predictive models** for clinical informatics and healthcare applications.

### 🧠 Current Research Areas

#### 🔹 Postpartum Mental Health
- Developed hybrid pipelines combining AutoML with LLM-based agents to predict **postpartum depression** using clinical notes from first hospital visits.

#### 🔹 Pediatric Epilepsy & Sleep Disorders
- Used AI agents and statistical modeling to analyze links between **sleep disorders** and **epilepsy** in pediatric patients.

#### 🔹 Rare Disease Cohort Identification
- Built LLM-powered agent pipelines with **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** to extract **HPO terms** and identify rare disease cohorts from unstructured clinical data.

#### 🔹 Immunodeficiency Phenotyping
- Engineered LLM-based tools for phenotype extraction from clinical notes, validated against clinician annotations.

#### 🔹 Pediatric Diabetes (T1D/T2D)
- Applied AutoML and agent-based inference systems to identify **DKA risk factors** in children with **Type 1 Diabetes**.

#### 🔹 Semantic Patient Matching
- Created a **semantic similarity AI agent** using RAG to match patients in large clinical databases, enhancing decision support.
